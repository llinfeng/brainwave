## Deployment

Deploying **Brainwave** involves setting up a Python-based environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and launching the server to handle real-time speech recognition and summarization. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+**: Ensure that Python 3.11 or higher is installed on your system.
- **uv**: A fast Python package manager and project manager. Install it from [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/llinfeng/brainwave.git
   cd brainwave
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies and Create Virtual Environment**

   Using uv, install all dependencies and create a virtual environment automatically:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   This command will:
   - Create a virtual environment in `.venv/`
   - Install all dependencies from `pyproject.toml`
   - Set up the project for development

   **To reinitialize/refresh the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall all packages (useful after environment issues or updates)
   uv sync --reinstall
   
   # Or completely remove and recreate the virtual environment
   rm -rf .venv
   uv sync
   ```

   **Virtual Environment Usage Options:**
   
   With uv, you have two ways to work with the virtual environment:
   
   - **Option 1 (Recommended): Use `uv run`** - No activation needed
     ```bash
     uv run python script.py
     uv run uvicorn realtime_server:app --port 3005
     uv run pytest tests/
     ```
   
   - **Option 2: Manual activation** - Traditional approach
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
     .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
     # Now run commands normally:
     python script.py
     uvicorn realtime_server:app --port 3005
     deactivate  # When finished
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Brainwave requires the OpenAI API key to function. Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

   - **On macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'
     ```

   - **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

     ```cmd
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
     ```

   - **On Windows (PowerShell):**

     ```powershell
     $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
     ```

   Optionally, you can configure where Brainwave saves audio recordings and transcripts by setting the `BRAINWAVE_RECORDINGS_DIR` environment variable:

   - **On macOS/Linux:**
     ```bash
     export BRAINWAVE_RECORDINGS_DIR='/path/to/your/recordings'
     ```

   - **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
     ```cmd
     set BRAINWAVE_RECORDINGS_DIR=C:\Users\YourUsername\Dropbox\Stable\AudioWrite
     ```

   - **On Windows (PowerShell):**
     ```powershell
     $env:BRAINWAVE_RECORDINGS_DIR="C:\Users\YourUsername\Dropbox\Stable\AudioWrite"
     ```

   If not set, recordings will be saved to a `recordings` directory in the project folder.

4. **Launch the Server**

   Start the FastAPI server using uv:

   ```bash
   uv run uvicorn realtime_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3005
   ```

   **Alternative hosting options:**
   ```bash
   # For local development only (localhost access)
   uv run uvicorn realtime_server:app --port 3005

   # For production with custom host and port
   uv run uvicorn realtime_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # With auto-reload for development
   uv run uvicorn realtime_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3005 --reload
   ```

   The server will be accessible at:
   - **Local access:** `http://localhost:3005`
   - **Network access:** `http://[your-machine-ip]:3005` (replace with your actual IP address for access from other devices)

   > **Note:** `uv run` automatically activates the virtual environment and runs the command with all dependencies available. No manual activation required!

5. **Access the Application**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3005` to interact with Brainwave's speech recognition interface.

### Hosting Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with hosting:

- **Port already in use:** Change the port number (e.g., `--port 3006`)
- **Permission denied on port 80/443:** Use a port number above 1024
- **Can't access from other devices:** Ensure you're using `--host 0.0.0.0` and check your firewall settings
- **Environment variables not found:** Make sure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your shell session

### Browser Troubleshooting

**Microsoft Edge Installed App Issues:**

If Brainwave is installed as an app in Microsoft Edge, it may occasionally stop recording audio. When this happens:

1. **Verify the fix will work:** Open Brainwave in an Edge private/incognito window. If it works there, this confirms the issue is with the installed app.
2. **Solution:** Uninstall the installed app and reinstall it. This will restore recording functionality.

**Sound Wave Indicator Issues:**

The sound wave indicator may not work properly in Firefox. If the indicator doesn't animate during recording (but recording itself works), switch to Chrome or Microsoft Edge where the indicator has been tested and works reliably.
